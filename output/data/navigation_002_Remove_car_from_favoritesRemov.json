More Ratings and reviews 4.5 (2 ratings) Reviews David • July 1, 2025 Car smelled of smoke but owner claimed no smoking violations in vehicle. Other than that no issues. Trinity RPM's response Appreciate your feedback. Just to clarify — this vehicle has never had any smoking violation( Turo pay $150 for it), and no odor concerns were mentioned during your trip. Your review came only after a fuel reimbursement was processed. Although the car was returned without refueling and in less-than-clean condition, we still chose to leave you a 5-star guest review. For future guests with scent sensitivities, we’re happy to offer one of our many brand-new vehicles — just let us know in advance. Mike • June 21, 2025 The 2024 CX-90 was an absolute pleasure to drive—smooth, powerful, and packed with great features. Easily one of the best cars I’ve rented on Turo! The hosts were just as great—communication was clear and quick, and pickup/drop-off couldn’t have been easier. Highly recommend both the vehicle and the hosts. Would definitely rent again! Rules of the road No smoking allowed Smoking in any Turo vehicle will result in a $150 fine Keep the vehicle tidy Unreasonably dirty vehicles may result in a $150 fine Refuel the vehicle Missing fuel may result in an additional fee No off-roading $425 $422 total Before taxes Your trip Trip start Midnight 12:30 AM 1:00 AM 1:30 AM 2:00 AM 2:30 AM 3:00 AM 3:30 AM 4:00 AM 4:30 AM 5:00 AM 5:30 AM 6:00 AM 6:30 AM 7:00 AM 7:30 AM 8:00 AM 8:30 AM 9:00 AM 9:30 AM 10:00 AM 10:30 AM 11:00 AM 11:30 AM Noon 12:30 PM 1:00 PM 1:30 PM 2:00 PM 2:30 PM 3:00 PM 3:30 PM 4:00 PM 4:30 PM 5:00 PM 5:30 PM 6:00 PM 6:30 PM 7:00 PM 7:30 PM 8:00 PM 8:30 PM 9:00 PM 9:30 PM 10:00 PM 10:30 PM 11:00 PM 11:30 PM Trip end Midnight 12:30 AM 1:00 AM 1:30 AM 2:00 AM 2:30 AM 3:00 AM 3:30 AM 4:00 AM 4:30 AM 5:00 AM 5:30 AM 6:00 AM 6:30 AM 7:00 AM 7:30 AM 8:00 AM 8:30 AM 9:00 AM 9:30 AM 10:00 AM 10:30 AM 11:00 AM 11:30 AM Noon 12:30 PM 1:00 PM 1:30 PM 2:00 PM 2:30 PM 3:00 PM 3:30 PM 4:00 PM 4:30 PM 5:00 PM 5:30 PM 6:00 PM 6:30 PM 7:00 PM 7:30 PM 8:00 PM 8:30 PM 9:00 PM 9:30 PM 10:00 PM 10:30 PM 11:00 PM 11:30 PM Pickup & return location SeaTac, WA 98188 Icon toggle button Pickup at car location SeaTac, WA 98188 Free We’ll send you the exact address once your trip is booked.
